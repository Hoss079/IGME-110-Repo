## [Belmont](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3322968173)
- One of the few mods that took literal years to develop
- Really well polished design wise, one of the few that actually is almost vanilla level

## [Tale](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3424917043)
- Another underratted gem of a mod thats a little more scuffed in balencing
